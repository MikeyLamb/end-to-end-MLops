## End to End Machine Learning Project
I am learning about basic end to end ML deployment and followed a tutorial on deploying a model to predict maths scores. In continuing the learning process, I am planning to create a new model and deploy it using these skills. 


# Student Exam Performance Predictor

This Flask web app predicts a student's exam performance based on input parameters. It includes a machine learning model trained on historical data to make predictions.
